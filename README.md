The purpose of our project is to create a secure money transfer solution that keeps transactions updated on the blockchain.

We used:
React, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask, MySQL, Google firebase, VS code, Webstorm


Problems we ran into:
First, a lot of out team has never used react includeing myself. We overcame this by watchinig tutorials and learning as much as we could.
I had to rely on the help of other team mates to fix my project build so I could view it on the web which took way too long. The second and probebly the biggest problem was that we kept pushing all of the edited files to the dev branch instead of just the important ones. This gave the whole team a lot of compiled files which broke other's project builds. Not having a clear grasp of how github works was caused a lot of issues for us throughout the night. We ran into the problem of not knowing how to connect the front end to the back end as well and still havent quite figured that part out. 

Public APIs or frameworks used:
python's hashlib for SHA256 hashing, JSON library
